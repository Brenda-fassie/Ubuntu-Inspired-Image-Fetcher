# 🌍 Ubuntu Image Fetcher

> “I am because we are.” – Ubuntu Philosophy  

A Python tool for **mindfully collecting images from the web**.  
It connects to the global community of the internet, respectfully fetches shared resources, and organizes them for later appreciation.

## ✨ Features

- **Community** – Enter one or multiple image URLs at once to fetch them all.
- **Respect** – Handles connection errors gracefully without crashing.
- **Sharing** – Organizes downloaded images inside a `Fetched_Images` folder.
- **Safety** – Verifies that downloaded files are actually images (by checking HTTP headers).
- **No duplicates** – Uses file hashing to avoid saving the same image twice.
